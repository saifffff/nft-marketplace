Task Overview : 
    Make Basic NFT marketplace ( Using solidity contracts and testnet Rinkeby or Matic Testnet )  Ex : Opensea.io

    Features :  
    1) Users login using metamask, 
    2) Mint tokens 
    3) Sell tokens 
    4) Royalty 
    5) Upload image using ipfs. 

    UI/UX Design : Basic like Ui/ux in React.js and web3.js



    basic setup is ready: lets start 
    we will be using hardhat for writing testing and deploying the solidity smart contract for the nft's as well as the market place,
    and reactJS for the front-end interactions.

    lets start by adding dependencies :)

    1 - we will need REACT-ROUTER-DOM for navigations since it doesn't comes bundled with the react
    2 - since we will be using IPFS we will also require HTTP IPFS CLIENT
    3- Also we will use OPENZeppelin to build secure smart contracts. It is essentially a contract library.
